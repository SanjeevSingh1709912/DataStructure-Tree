# DataStructure-Tree
My Tree List for Algorithm 

Types of binery trees.
1. Full Binery Tree : 
				1. Either have 0 or 2 children  
2. Complete Binery Tree : 
        1.All level should be completely filled except the last level
        2.Last level have all the node as left as possible
3. perfect Binery Tree :
        1. All Leaf node are at the same levels 
4. Balanced Binery Tree :
        1. Hight can be at max log(N). Where N is number of node in binery tree
5. Degenerate Binery Tree :
        1. It is like linked list
